##  About Me

Hi there! I'm a data analyst and data engineer with over 20 years of experience in analytics, IT support, and systems management. I specialize in designing and building robust data pipelines, managing cloud-based infrastructure, and empowering data-driven decisions through analytics and visualization.

My journey spans across educational institutions, military intelligence, and non-profit sectors — bringing a unique, mission-focused perspective to technology solutions.

##  Projects

Here are a few projects I’ve worked on:

- **Locker Management Web App**  
  A full-stack web app to manage student lockers, built using Flask, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL. Includes user roles for admins, teachers, and students.

- **AWS Redshift Data Warehouse & ETL Pipeline**
  This project builds an ETL pipeline for Sparkify, a music streaming startup, using Amazon Redshift.
  The pipeline extracts JSON log & song data from AWS S3, stages it in Redshift, and transforms it into a star
  schema for analytical queries.
