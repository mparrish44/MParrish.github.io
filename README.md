##  About Me

Hi there! I'm a data analyst and data engineer with over 20 years of experience in analytics, IT support, and systems management. I specialize in designing and building robust data pipelines, managing cloud-based infrastructure, and empowering data-driven decisions through analytics and visualization.

My journey spans across educational institutions, military intelligence, and non-profit sectors — bringing a unique, mission-focused perspective to technology solutions.
